        <p>Universality:
    29
    Universals are cultural traits that span across all cultures. Most are biologically that
    distinguish us from other species – Long period of infant dependency – Year-round sexuality
    – Complex brain that enables use of symbols, languages, and tools Social universals – Life in
    groups – Some kind of family – Culture organizes on social life Depends on social
    interactions for expression and continuation – Incest taboo – Exogamy (marriage outside
    one’s group).
    A great example of universality is that whether in Africa or Asia, Australia, or Antarctica,
    people understand the universal concept of family. Anthropologists would argue that it's
    just what we as humans do - we organize ourselves into families that are based on biology.
    No matter where you choose to travel and explore, you'll find a family system.
    2) Generality:
    Generalities are cultural traits that occur in many societies but not all of them. Societies can
    share same beliefs and customs because of borrowing Domination (colonial rule) when
    customs and procedures are imposed on one culture can also cause generality Independent
    innovation of same cultural trait – Farming Examples: – Nuclear family Parents and children.
    3) Particularity:
    Trait of a culture that is not widespread Cultural borrowing – traits once limited are more
    widespread Useful traits that don’t clash with current culture get borrowed Examples: –
    Food dishes Particularities are becoming rarer in some ways but also becoming more
    obvious Borrowed cultural traits are modified Marriage, parenthood, death, puberty, birth
    all celebrated differently.
    2.5. Evaluating Cultural Differences: Ethnocentrism, Cultural Relativism and
    Human Rights
    The concepts of ethnocentrism and cultural relativism occupy key position in anthropology.
