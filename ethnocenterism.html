        <p>ETHNOCENTRISM:
    The common response in all societies to other cultures is to judge them in terms of the
    values and customs of their own familiar culture. Ethnocentrism refers to the tendency to
    see the behaviors, beliefs, values, and norms of one's own group as the only right way of
    living and to judge others by those standards.
    Being fond of your own way of life and condescending or even hostile toward other cultures
    is normal for all people. Because of ethnocentrism, we often operate on the premise that
    our own society’s ways are the correct, normal, better ways, for acting, thinking, feeling and
    behaving. Our own group is the centre or axis of everything, and we scale and rate all others
    with reference to it. Ethnocentrism is not characteristic only of complex modern societies.
    People in small, relatively isolated societies are also ethnocentric in their views about
    outsiders. It is a cultural universal. Alien cultural traits are often viewed as being not just
    different but inferior, less sensible, and even "unnatural”.
    Ethnocentrism results in prejudices about people from other cultures and the rejection of
    their "alien ways." Our ethnocentrism can prevent us from understanding and appreciating
    another culture. When there is contact with people from other cultures, ethnocentrism can
    prevent open communication and result in misunderstanding and mistrust. This would be
    highly counterproductive for businessmen trying to negotiate a trade deal, professionals
    who work in areas other than their own or even just neighbors trying to get along with each
    other. The positive aspect of ethnocentrism has to do with the protection that it can provide
    for a culture. By causing a rejection of the foods, customs, and perceptions of people in
    other cultures, it acts as a conservative force in preserving traditions of one's own culture. It
    can help maintain the separation and uniqueness of cultures </p>>
