        <p>Culture is reflected through the various components that it comprises, viz., values, language,
    myths, customs, rituals and laws. Two of the most basic aspects of culture are material and
    nonmaterial culture. These are briefly explained as follows;
    Material culture consist of man-made objects such as tools, implements, furniture,
    automobiles, buildings, dams, roads, bridges, and in fact, the physical substance which has
    been changed and used by man. It is concerned with the external, mechanical and utilitarian
    objects. It includes technical and material equipment. It is referred to as civilization.</p>
    <p>The term ‘culture’ when used in the ordinary sense, means ‘non-material culture’. It is
    something internal and intrinsically valuable, reflects the inward nature of man. Nonmaterial culture consists of the words the people use or the language they speak, the beliefs
    they hold, values and virtues they cherish, habits they follow, rituals and practices that they
    do and the ceremonies they observe. It also includes our customs and tastes, attitudes and
    outlook, in brief, our ways of acting, feeling and thinking. Some of the aspects of nonmaterial culture listed as follows:
    Values:
    Values are the standards by which member of a society define what is good or bad,
    beautiful or ugly. Every society develops both values and expectations regarding the right
    way to reflect them.
    Values are a central aspect of the nonmaterial culture of a society and are important
    because they influence the behavior of the members of a society.
    Beliefs
    Beliefs are cultural conventions that concern true or false assumptions, specific descriptions
    of the nature of the universe and humanity’s place in it. Values are generalized notions of
    what is good and bad; beliefs are more specific and, in form at least, have more content.
    “Education is good” is a fundamental value in American society, whereas “Grading is the 
    28
    best way to evaluate students” is a belief that reflects assumptions about the most
    appropriate way to determine educational achievement.</p>
    <P>
    Norms are another aspect of nonmaterial culture. Norms are shared rules or guidelines that
    define how people “ought” to behave under certain circumstances. Norms are generally
    connected to the values, beliefs, and ideologies of a society.
    Norms vary in terms of their importance to a culture, these are:
    a) Folkway: Norms guiding ordinary usages and conventions of everyday life are known
    as folkways. Folkways are norms that are not strictly enforced, such as not leaving
    your seat for an elderly people inside a bus/taxi. They may result in a person getting
    a bad look.
    b) Mores: Mores (pronounced MOR-ays) are much stronger norms than are folkways.
    Mores are norms that are believed to be essential to core values and we insist on
    conformity. A person who steals, rapes, and kills has violated some of society’s most
    important mores.
    People who violate mores are usually severely punished, although punishment for the
    violation of mores varies from society to society. It may take the form of ostracism, vicious
    gossip, public ridicule, exile, loss of one’s job, physical beating, imprisonment, commitment
    to a mental asylum, or even execution
    2.4 Cultural Unity and Variations: Universality, Generality and Particularity of
    Culture
    In studying human diversity in time and space, anthropologists distinguish among the
    universal, the generalized, and the particular.
    Certain biological, psychological, social, and cultural features are universal (found in every
    culture), others are merely generalities (common to several but not all human groups),
    other traits are particularities (unique to certain cultural traditions).</P>
